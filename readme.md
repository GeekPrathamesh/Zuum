## Overview

ZUUM is a full-stack real-time chat application inspired by WhatsApp.  
It supports secure authentication, one-to-one messaging, online/offline presence, and image sharing using WebSockets.

The frontend is built with React, while the backend uses Node.js, Express, and Socket.io for real-time communication. The application is deployed using AWS EC2 and NGINX.

## Real-Time Architecture

- Users connect via Socket.io using their `userId`
- Online users are tracked using a socket-to-user map
- Messages are emitted instantly if the receiver is online
- Messages are stored in MongoDB
- Online user list is broadcast to all connected clients

---

## Authentication Flow

1. User signs up or logs in  
2. Server generates a JWT token  
3. Token is sent in request headers  
4. Protected routes validate token middleware  
5. Socket connection attaches `userId` via handshake query
